Objective

Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

Tools

MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (any can be used)

Theory Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and analyze data stored in relational databases. It provides powerful operations for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joining across multiple tables.

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY → For retrieving and filtering rows.

GROUP BY + Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) → For summarizing data.

JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) → For combining related tables.

Subqueries → Nested queries to answer complex questions.

Views → Virtual tables to simplify analysis.

Indexes → Improve performance of frequently used queries.

Deliverables

Task4_SQL_Analysis.sql → Contains all queries.

Screenshots → Results of running each query.

Theory notes → Short documentation explaining SQL concepts.
